Introduction
  </h3>

  <p>
    I am Felix (Jianhao) Zhou, a Master of Urban Planning Candidate at NYU Wagner specializing in Environment, Infrastructure and Transportation. I am currently working as an Intern with the Planning, Development, and Transportation Division of New York City
    Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC). I helped create interactive Choropleth maps as visualizations of internal database, conduct studies of city-owned development sites, and prepare ULURP, RFPs, and environmental review documents. Additionally,
    I am serving as a capstone project consultant for the Sustainability Initiatives Office of Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to build a full-scale mock-up of an avoided emissions commodity, and make analysis of what factors will allow for
    a transit avoided carbon market to become vibrant.
    <br/>
    <br/> Interests include applied science that promote sustainable and smart cities, planning that improves infrastructure financing, and urban resilience that help city adapt and grow when faced with chronic stresses and acute shocks. Previously I served
    as interns I hold two Bachelor of Arts degrees in sociology and English from Renmin University of China.
